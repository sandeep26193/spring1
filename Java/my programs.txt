demo.java = demo of static and non static variables
st1.java= static and non static variables usage
st2.java= usage methods of static variables
--------------------------------------------------

how to access static variables from one class to another class

test.java and test1.java
------------------------------------------------------------------

default initialization

non static and static variables

default initialiation is applicable to static and non static applicable 
its not applicable to non local variables

Type casting : one primitive type variable value assign into another primitive data type variable is called typecasting


int x=45; the value is asssigned into the b value which is byte
byte b=x;

1.explict type: in the our specification: Bigger value assigned into smaller value====== ex.java
2.implicit: jvm automatically assign the value from one datatype to another type variable

smaller value assign into bigger value------im.java


Inheritance:

accessing the properties from one class to another class
or 
one object to another object


syntax
class subclass extends to superclass
{

}

class B extends to A

Note:

1. without superclass object we can create a subclass object
2.when we are creating subclass object automatically superclass object will be created


Multi level inheritance

One class extends only one class in association level is multilevel heritance

Java support only

when the subclass doesnot have a main method then the superclass will be excecuted


Object class or root object
